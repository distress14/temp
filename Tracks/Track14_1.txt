Open funmail with IDA

Used IDA to understand easly the program. I noticed that there's no call to the showEmails function. So i try to jump to it using gdb

Open funmail with gdb

gdb ./funmail2.0

(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0xb33


(gdb) run

Hey John it's Leeroy.
You were asking about a fun flag to use in your next challenge
and I think I got one. Tell me what you think of:
TUCTF{l0c4l_<_r3m073_3x3cu710n}
Get back to me as soon as you can. Thanks!
